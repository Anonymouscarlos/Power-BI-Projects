The primary goal of this initiative is to aid organizations in enhancing employee performance, improving employee retention, and reducing attrition through data-driven insights. 

To accurately assess employee performance and retention, I've utilized various key performance indicators (KPIs), including overall employee count, attrition statistics, attrition rate, average employee age, salary benchmarks, and the average duration of an employee's tenure with the company.

**Key Insights**

1. The highest attrition rates were observed in Life Sciences Education (38%) and the Laboratory Technician job role (62%).

2. Out of a total of 237 employees who left the company, 150 were male, and 81 were female and the age group of 26-35 experienced the highest attrition.

3. Attrition was found to be directly related to job satisfaction and varied among different job roles. Lower job satisfaction correlated with a higher likelihood of attrition.

4. Despite an average salary of 6.5K, employees earning below this threshold had a higher attrition risk.
